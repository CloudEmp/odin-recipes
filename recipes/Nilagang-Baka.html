    <h2>Where did Nilagang Baka came from?</h2>
    <p>Nilagang Baka is a dish that people have been cooking for quite a long time. In fact, 
        it arrived in the Philippines even before the colonial era, as Austronesians 
        introduced the technique of boiling food. And as such, people thought to boil their 
        beef, and integrate a couple of spices. To build the entire meal, they also added vegetables such as potatoes, 
        cabbage and onions, all of which we still use in todayâ€™s recipe
